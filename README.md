ðŸ§¬ Phylogenetic Analysis Using Biopython and Cytochrome b Gene Sequences

ðŸ“˜ Introduction  
In the realm of evolutionary biology and molecular genetics, understanding the evolutionary relationships between species is crucial. **Phylogeny**, the study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms, utilizes phylogenetic trees to visualize and analyze these relationships. Each branch in a phylogenetic tree represents a lineage, with the lengths and patterns of branches indicating the evolutionary distances and relatedness between species.

ðŸŒ³ What is Phylogeny?  
Phylogeny is the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms, often depicted in a phylogenetic tree. These trees illustrate the divergence of species from common ancestors over time, crucial for understanding biodiversity and evolutionary processes.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim  
The aim of this project is to construct and analyze a phylogenetic tree to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between pairs of species based on their genetic data, specifically using the **cytochrome b gene**. By leveraging **Biopython** and various computational methods, this project serves as a practical exercise to enhance my skills in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.

ðŸ”¬ Phylogenetic Analysis Techniques  
For this project, I have employed methods for constructing phylogenetic trees using **distance matrices** derived from genetic data. By analyzing the resulting tree, I aim to evaluate the evolutionary closeness between different species. The project highlights the importance of phylogenetic analysis in understanding species relationships and evolutionary processes.

ðŸ“‚ Data Description

The accession numbers for the 25 species used in this analysis are listed in data/accessions.json. The sequences were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database using Biopython's Entrez module.

ðŸŒ³ Result  
Hereâ€™s the phylogenetic tree generated in this project:
